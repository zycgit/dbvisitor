## Prerequisites

Before using `LambdaTemplate`, prepare a data source just like you would for [JdbcTemplate](../jdbc/about). You can also pass an existing `JdbcTemplate` into the `LambdaTemplate` constructor to share the same database connection.

- Ensure you have object mappings for the database tables you operate on.
- Annotations are one way to configure mappings; see [Object Mapping](../mapping/about) for more options and details.

```java title='1. Create an object mapping for the users table via annotations'
@Table("users")
public class User {
    @Column(name = "id", primary = true, keyType = KeyTypeEnum.Auto)
    private Long id;
    @Column("name")
    private String name;
    ... // getters/setters omitted
}
```

- `@Table` marks the type as an entity and sets the table name it maps to.
- `@Column` defines the mapping between fields and columns.
- In the example, `id` is marked as the primary key and is auto-incremented by the database.

```java title='2. Create the builder'
DataSource dataSource = ...;
LambdaTemplate lambda = new LambdaTemplate(dataSource);

// or

Connection conn = ...;
LambdaTemplate lambda = new LambdaTemplate(conn);
```

- Use the methods on `lambda` to perform reads and writes.
- By default, `LambdaTemplate` uses `RegistryManager.DEFAULT` to manage type mappings.

## How It Works {#principle}

`LambdaTemplate` provides `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `query`, and `freedom` methods to operate on tables:

- insert generates and executes INSERT statements.
- update generates and executes UPDATE statements.
- delete generates and executes DELETE statements.
- query generates and executes SELECT statements.

You describe how to build SQL and arguments in code; at runtime the SQL is generated and executed through `JdbcTemplate` to return results.

## Guide {#guide}

- [Insert](./insert): write data, batch for efficiency, and handle conflicts.
- [Update](./update): three update methods and how to avoid unsafe updates.
- [Delete](./delete): delete data with `LambdaTemplate`.
- [Query](./query): query data with the constructor APIs provided by dbVisitor.
- [Where builder](./where-builder): build rich conditions for `update`, `delete`, and `query`.
- [Group by](./groupby): perform grouped queries.
- [Order by](./orderby): apply ordering to queries.
- [Map APIs](./for-map): Map remains a handy container alongside entity classes.
- [Freedom mode](./freedom): build and execute SQL with Maps even without mapped entity classes.
