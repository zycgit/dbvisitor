dbVisitor provides several annotations that you can place on interface methods so they act as database access mediators, eliminating verbose JDBC code.

```java title='1. Method annotations keep SQL separate from invocation logic'
@SimpleMapper
public interface UserMapper {
    @Query("select * from users where id > ?")
    List<User> listUsers(long searchId);
}
```

```java title='2. Build a BaseMapper'
// 1. Create the Configuration
Configuration config = new Configuration();

// 2. Create the Session
Session session = config.newSession(dataSource);
or
Session session = config.newSession(connection);

// 3. Create the Mapper
UserMapper mapper = session.createMapper(UserMapper.class);
List<User> result = mapper.listUsers(2);
```

## Usage Guide

Define any number of methods on your Mapper interface and annotate them with the appropriate SQL annotation to interact with the database.
- [@Query](./query): runs a query that returns a result set and maps it to the method return value.
- [@Insert](./insert): executes an INSERT statement.
- [@Update](./update): executes an UPDATE statement.
- [@Delete](./delete): executes a DELETE statement.
- [@Execute](./execute): executes any SQL, e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL.
- [@Call](./call): executes a stored procedure.
- [@Segment](./segment): defines a SQL snippet that can be referenced by other SQL methods in the same Mapper through macro rules.
- [Rules](../../rules/about): add powerful behaviors to SQL statements via rule definitions within SQL.
