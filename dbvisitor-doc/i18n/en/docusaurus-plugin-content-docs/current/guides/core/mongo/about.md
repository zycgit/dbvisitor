dbVisitor accesses MongoDB via the [JDBC-Mongo](../../drivers/mongo/about) driver over JDBC. Note:
- Use MongoDB commands; see [supported commands](../../drivers/mongo/commands).
- Supports [JdbcTemplate](./exec_command), [method annotations](./exec_annotation), and [Mapper File](./exec_file.mdx).
- Supports [rules](../../rules/about) and [argument passing](../../args/about) for complex command building.
- Supports [ResultSetExtractor, RowMapper](../../result/about) for consuming results.
- Supports [Dynamic Command](../file/dynamic) tags in mapper files.
- Supports [Fluent API](../lambda/about) and [BaseMapper](../mapper/common).
- Supports **ObjectMapping** and **ResultMapping**.
- Does not support JdbcTemplate `executeBatch`.
- Does not support JdbcTemplate stored procedure APIs.

## Analogy

MongoDB commands return one of three shapes: **UpdateCount**, **Single Result**, or **ResultSet**.
- Update count: similar to relational INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; call `executeUpdate`.
- Single/multi row: similar to SELECT queries; all read commands (and commands that cannot report via update count) return result sets.
- Result sets expose `_ID` (first column) and `_JSON` (second column), both as strings.

## Guide {#guide}

Execute commands
- [JSONB Query](./exec_command): run raw MongoDB commands via JdbcTemplate.
- [Fluent API](./exec_lambda): type-safe MongoDB operations with LambdaTemplate.
- [BaseMapper](./exec_mapper): simplify CRUD with BaseMapper.
- [Annotations](./exec_annotation): use @Insert/@Update/@Delete on mapper interfaces for customized CRUD.
- [Mapper File](./exec_file.mdx): configure commands via XML tags.
