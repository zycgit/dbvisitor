dbVisitor accesses ElasticSearch data sources via the JDBC protocol through the [JDBC-Elastic](../../drivers/elastic/about) driver. Please note the following when using it:
- Operate data using ElasticSearch DSL commands. Refer to [Supported Commands](../../drivers/elastic/commands) for available commands.
- Supports operating ElasticSearch data sources using [JdbcTemplate](./exec_command), [Method Annotations](./exec_annotation), and [Mapper File](./exec_file.mdx).
- Supports using [Rules](../../rules/about) and [Argument Passing](../../args/about) for complex command generation and parameter passing.
- Supports using interfaces like [ResultSetExtractor, RowMapper](../../result/about) to receive query results.
- Supports using [Dynamic SQL](../file/dynamic) tags in Mapper Files to generate execution commands.
- Supports [Fluent API](../lambda/about) or [Common Mapper](../mapper/common).
- Supports **Object Mapping**, **Result Set Mapping**.
- Does NOT support **executeBatch** method of **JdbcTemplate**.
- Does NOT support Stored Procedure API of **JdbcTemplate**.

## Concept Analogy

In the commands provided by the ElasticSearch driver, different commands have different execution results, mainly three types (**Update Count**, **Single Row Result**, **Multi-row Result**):
- Update Count: Analogous to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements in relational databases, requiring `executeUpdate` method to execute and get results.
- Single Row Result / Multi-row Result: Equivalent to getting query result sets when using SELECT statements in relational databases. In the ElasticSearch driver, all read commands and some commands that cannot return via update count use the result set format.
- When retrieving the result set, the first column is the `_ID` field, and the second column is the `_DOC` field. Both fields are in string format.

## User Guide {#guide}

Execute Commands
- [Command Style](./exec_command): Use JdbcTemplate to execute raw ElasticSearch commands for reading and writing data.
- [Fluent API](./exec_lambda): Use LambdaTemplate for type-safe ElasticSearch operations.
- [BaseMapper](./exec_mapper): Use BaseMapper interface to simplify ElasticSearch CRUD operations.
- [Annotation Style](./exec_annotation): Use @Insert, @Update, @Delete annotations on Mapper interfaces to customize ElasticSearch CRUD operations.
- [File Style](./exec_file.mdx): Configure execution commands via tags in Mapper files.
