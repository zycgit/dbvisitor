# JdbcTemplate

`JdbcTemplate` is a database operation wrapper designed by dbVisitor specifically for **SQL string** scenarios. It is stateless and can be created and destroyed at any time.

```java title='Creation and Usage'
JdbcTemplate jdbc = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

// Query
List<Map<String, Object>> rows = jdbc.queryForList("select * from users where age > ?", 18);

// Update
int affected = jdbc.executeUpdate("update users set name = ? where id = ?", "alice", 1);
```

:::tip[Hint]
How you obtain JdbcTemplate depends on your project architecture. See **[Framework Integration](../../yourproject/buildtools#integration)** for details.
:::

## Principle

JdbcTemplate is based on the Template pattern. Inside the template method, it automatically handles acquiring connections, releasing connections, and catching exceptions. Higher-level code only needs to focus on using the Connection.

```java title='Core Template Method'
T result = jdbc.execute((ConnectionCallback<T>) con -> {
   // Use Connection directly
});
```
