dbVisitor accesses Redis over the JDBC protocol via the [JDBC-Redis](../../drivers/redis/about) driver. Keep these points in mind:
- Use native Redis commands to operate on data; supported commands are listed in the [Commands](../../drivers/redis/commands).
- Three access styles are available: [JdbcTemplate](./exec_command), [Annotations](./exec_annotation), and [Mapper File](./exec_file.mdx).
- [Rules](../../rules/about) and [Arguments](../../args/about) help build complex commands and pass arguments.
- Query results can be handled with interfaces such as [ResultSetExtractor, RowMapper](../../result/about).
- Mapper files support [Dynamic Command](../file/dynamic) tags to build executable commands.
- **Fluent API** and **BaseMapper** APIs are not supported.
- **ObjectMapping** and **ResultMapping** are not supported.
- `JdbcTemplate` does **not** support `executeBatch`.
- `JdbcTemplate` stored procedure APIs are not supported.

:::tip[Tip]
Even though Redis usage does not support **ObjectMapping**, you can still synchronize data between relational databases and Redis by first setting up object mappings and then reusing existing APIs.

## Conceptual Mapping

Commands in the Redis driver return three kinds of results: **UpdateCount**, **Single Result**, and **ResultSet**.
- Update count behaves like INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in relational databases and should be obtained with `executeUpdate`.
- Single-row and multi-row results are similar to a SELECT returning a result set; all read commands and commands that cannot return an update count use result sets.

## Guide {#guide}

Execute commands
- [Command](./exec_command): use `JdbcTemplate` to run raw Redis commands for reads and writes.
- [Annotations](./exec_annotation): place `@Insert`, `@Update`, and `@Delete` on Mapper interface methods to encapsulate Redis operations.
- [File Mapper](./exec_file.mdx): configure commands in Mapper files via tags.

Read/write Redis data types
- [String](./redis_type#string): read/write Redis String values with dbVisitor.
- [Hash](./redis_type#hash): read/write Redis Hash values with dbVisitor.
- [List](./redis_type#list): read/write Redis List values with dbVisitor.
- [Set](./redis_type#set): read/write Redis Set values with dbVisitor.
- [Sorted Set](./redis_type#sorted_set): read/write Redis Sorted Set values with dbVisitor.
