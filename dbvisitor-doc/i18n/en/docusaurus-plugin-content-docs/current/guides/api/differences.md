# Data Source Differences

dbVisitor strives to use a unified API to operate on all **Relational DataBases** and **NoSQL DataBases**. In practice, data sources still have differences due to their own characteristics.
dbVisitor handles these differences mainly in two ways:
- **API support**: whether a called API is supported on a given data source.
- **Database dialect**: when using the [Fluent API](./lambda_api), the same API may generate different commands or syntax depending on the database.

## API Support {#api}

dbVisitor provides four major APIs under a unified core: [Programmatic API](./program_api), [Declarative API](./declarative_api), [Fluent API](./lambda_api), and [Mapper File](./file_mapper).

For **relational databases** that rely on SQL, all dbVisitor APIs are available. For finer-grained differences, refer to the [Dialect](./differences#dialect) section below.

For **non-relational databases**, see the guides below for specific differences:
- [Redis Specifics](../core/redis/about)
- [MongoDB Specifics](../core/mongo/about)

## Database Dialect {#dialect}

Thanks to the SQL standard, most data sources that support SQL and provide JDBC drivers can run normally. The table below lists dialect support differences for the [Fluent API](./lambda_api).
