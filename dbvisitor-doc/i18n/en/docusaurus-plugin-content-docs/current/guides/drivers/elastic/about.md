jdbc-elastic is an ElasticSearch JDBC adapter that lets developers operate ElasticSearch via standard JDBC interfaces and native REST API commands. The goal is to let you use ElasticSearch seamlessly with the familiar JDBC programming model.

## Core Features

- **Native Command Support**: Supports common ElasticSearch REST API commands, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.
- **JDBC Standard Interface**: Supports `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet` etc.
- **Parameter Placeholders**: Supports `?` placeholders in URL paths and JSON Body, and setting parameters via `PreparedStatement`.
- **ResultSet Mapping**: Automatically maps ElasticSearch JSON responses to JDBC `ResultSet`.
- **Auto Generated Keys**: Supports `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`, automatically returning the generated `_id` on insert.
- **Multi-Command Support**: Supports batch operations like `_mget`, `_msearch`.
- **Index Management**: Supports index creation, deletion, Mapping settings, Settings configuration, Alias management, etc.
- **Pre-read Optimization**: Supports pre-read configuration for large result sets to optimize read performance.
- **Multi-Version Compatibility**: Compatible with ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9 without adjusting dependencies.

## Architecture

Internally parses QueryDSL commands, converts them into underlying REST requests, and communicates using the official ElasticSearch REST Client.

## Use Cases

- Need unified (JDBC) access to ElasticSearch in Java projects.
- Prefer to use native REST API style commands for ElasticSearch.
- Need to integrate ElasticSearch into existing JDBC-based data processing flows.
