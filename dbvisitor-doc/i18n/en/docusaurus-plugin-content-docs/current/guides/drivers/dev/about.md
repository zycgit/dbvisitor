With dbvisitor-driver you can more easily extend data-source support so applications access diverse databases in a unified way. It fits scenarios such as:
- Integrating non-relational databases into JDBC-based apps.
- Projects that need to expose JDBC interfaces for custom data sources.
- Providing a unified database interface to dbVisitor so apps access different databases consistently.

## Architecture

The project uses an interface-driven design with these core pieces:

1. Driver entry
   - `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.JdbcDriver` implements `java.sql.Driver`, handling URL parsing and connection creation.
   - All adapters follow JDBC URL format `jdbc:dbvisitor:<adapterName>//<server?param=value>`.
2. Adapter manager
   - `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterManager` manages and loads adapter factories via Java SPI discovery/registration.
3. JDBC standard layer
   - Classes under `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.*` prefixed with `Jdbc` implement standard JDBC interfaces.
4. Adapter layer
   - `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterFactory` is the adapter connection factory that creates `AdapterConnection` instances.
   - `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterConnection` is the abstract adapter connection handling requests/responses.
5. Type support
   - `TypeSupport`, `AdapterTypeSupport`: data type conversion support.
   - `ConvertUtils`: utilities for type conversions.

## Technical Highlights
- SPI-based: dynamically load adapters via Java SPI for a pluggable, loosely coupled design.
- Type conversion: flexible system for mapping data types.
- Request/response model: handles DB operations in a request/response flow to fit varied data sources.
- Compatibility: aims to comply with standard JDBC, with some limitations.
