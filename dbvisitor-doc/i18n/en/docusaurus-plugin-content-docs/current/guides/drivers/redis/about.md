jdbc-redis is a Redis JDBC adapter that lets developers operate Redis via standard JDBC interfaces and Redis commands. The goal is to use Redis seamlessly through the familiar JDBC programming model.

## Core Features

- JDBC compatible: implements standard JDBC interfaces and integrates with any JDBC-capable framework.
- Supports **140+** common commands across [DB](./commands#server), [Server](./commands#server), [Keys](./commands#keys), [List](./commands#list), [Set](./commands#set), [StoreSet](./commands#storeset), [String](./commands#string), and [Hash](./commands#hash).
- Supports command placeholders `?` with `PreparedStatement` for bind arguments.
- Supports executing multiple commands and retrieving multiple results via standard JDBC methods.
- Supports `Statement` properties: `maxRows`, `fetchSize`, `timeoutSec`.
- Supports interceptors for logging, performance monitoring, etc.
- Supports type conversion; e.g., a `LONG` result can be read via `ResultSet.getInt` or `getString`.
- Supports `BLOB`, `CLOB`, `NCLOB` reads.

## Architecture

Internally uses the official Redis driver for communication, parses commands with ANTLR4, and translates them to Redis API calls.

## Use Cases

- Need unified (JDBC) access to Redis in Java projects.
- Prefer to use original Redis command syntax.
- Need to integrate Redis into existing JDBC-based data processing flows.
