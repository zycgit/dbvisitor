dbVisitor adapters were introduced in version 6.1.0. They provide a flexible JDBC driver adapter implementation that abstracts JDBC driver details, letting non-relational databases integrate quickly into JDBC-based applications via a request/response model.
As a general JDBC driver adapter, it tackles three core problems:
- Simplify driver implementation: abstract JDBC complexity so developers can more easily build JDBC-compatible layers for various data sources.
- Integrate non-relational databases: allow NoSQL to be accessed through a standardized JDBC interface.
- Integrate with dbVisitor: standardize JDBC interfaces to work smoothly with dbVisitor, simplifying database access.

## Guide

- Provided adapters
  - **[jdbc-redis](./redis/about)**: Redis JDBC adapter; operate Redis using standard JDBC interfaces plus Redis commands.
  - **[jdbc-mongo](./mongo/about)**: MongoDB JDBC adapter; operate MongoDB using standard JDBC interfaces plus MongoDB commands.
- Build a new adapter
  - **[Custom adapter](./dev/about)**: learn how to build your own JDBC driver adapter and provide a JDBC-compatible layer for any database.
