jdbc-mongo is a MongoDB JDBC adapter that lets developers operate MongoDB via standard JDBC interfaces and MongoDB commands. The goal is to let you use MongoDB seamlessly with the familiar JDBC programming model.

## Core Features

- JDBC compatible: implements standard JDBC interfaces and integrates with any JDBC-capable framework.
- Rich command set: supports common MongoDB commands including [Collections](./commands#collection), [Database](./commands#database), [Index](./commands#index), and [User](./commands#user).
- Supports command placeholders `?` with `PreparedStatement` for bind arguments.
- Supports multiple commands executed together and retrieving multiple results via standard JDBC methods.
- Supports `Statement` properties: `maxRows`, `fetchSize`, `timeoutSec`.
- Supports `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`, automatically returning the generated `_id` on insert.
- Supports interceptors for logging, performance monitoring, etc.
- Supports type conversion; e.g., a `LONG` result can be read via `ResultSet.getInt` or `getString`.
- Supports `BLOB`, `CLOB`, `NCLOB` reads.

## Architecture

Internally uses the official MongoDB driver for communication, ANTLR4 to parse commands, and converts them to MongoDB BSON operations.

## Use Cases

- Need unified (JDBC) access to MongoDB in Java projects.
- Prefer to use the original command syntax for MongoDB.
- Need to integrate MongoDB into existing JDBC-based data processing flows.
