Because jdbc-redis is built on dbvisitor-driver, JDBC support is limited as follows:

- Properties from `DatabaseMetaData` are unreliable.
- For `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, `resultSetHoldability`, and `fetchDirection`, only the defaults are supported:
  - resultSetType = TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
  - resultSetConcurrency = CONCUR_READ_ONLY
  - resultSetHoldability = HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT
  - fetchDirection = FETCH_FORWARD
- For `ResultSet`, update/insert/deleteXXX mutation methods are not supported.
- For `Statement`/`PreparedStatement`, overloads with these signatures are not supported:
  - xxx(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)
  - xxx(String sql, String[] columnNames)
- Unsupported JDBC types: SQLXML, REF_CURSOR, RowId, Ref, Struct, DISTINCT.
- Batch operations `addBatch`, `clearBatch` are unsupported.
- Savepoints are unsupported.
- Array, Blob, Clob, NClob data are fully read into memory; mind the size.
