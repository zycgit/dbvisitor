# Geospatial type handlers

Geospatial handlers live in `net.hasor.dbvisitor.types.handler.geo`. Add the JTS dependency before using them:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.locationtech.jts</groupId>
   <artifactId>jts-core</artifactId>
   <version>1.19.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Formats

OpenGIS defines two formats:
- Well-Known Text (WKT) as strings
- Well-Known Binary (WKB) as byte[]

## Store as WKT {#wkt}

Read as WKT and convert to WKB, or accept WKB and write WKT to the database.
- Use `JtsGeometryWktAsWkbTypeHandler` for this.

```text
数据库     应用
 WKT  ->  WKB
 WKT  <-  WKB
```

## Store as WKB {#wkb}

Read as WKB and convert to WKT, or accept WKT and write WKB to the database.
- Use `JtsGeometryWkbAsWktTypeHandler` for this.

```text
数据库     应用
 WKB  ->  WKT
 WKB  <-  WKT
```

## Store as WKB (HEX) {#hex}

Read as WKB(HEX) and convert to WKT, or accept WKT and write WKB(HEX) to the database.
- Use `JtsGeometryWkbHexAsWktTypeHandler` for this.

```text
  数据库       应用
WKB(HEX)  ->  WKT
WKB(HEX)  <-  WKT
```
