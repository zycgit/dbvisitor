dbVisitor includes a lightweight local transaction manager that supports all 7 transaction propagation behaviors and 5 isolation levels.
You can control transactions in three ways; the specific choice depends on your project requirements.

## Usage Guide

Concepts
- [Local Transaction Manager](./manager/about): understand how the dbVisitor transaction manager works and the transaction stack mechanism.
- [Propagation Behavior](./propagation): understand the differences and applicable scenarios of the 7 propagation behaviors.
- [Isolation Levels](./isolation): understand how different isolation levels affect concurrent reads and writes.

How to use
- [Programmatic Transactions](./manager/program): manually call `begin/commit/rollBack` to control transactions — flexible but more verbose.
- [Transaction Template](./manager/template): execute transaction code blocks via `TransactionTemplate`, with automatic commit/rollback handling.
- [Annotation-based Transactions](./manager/annotation): declaratively control transactions via `@Transactional` annotations — the most concise code.
