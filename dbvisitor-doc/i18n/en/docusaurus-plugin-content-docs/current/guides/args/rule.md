# Rule Parameters

Pass parameters and invoke the built-in rule engine in SQL using the `@{...}` syntax. This allows SQL statements to change dynamically based on parameter values without writing complex `if/else` logic or XML tags.

## Why Use Rules

*   **Simple and Intuitive**: Get rid of complex XML tags (like MyBatis's `<if>`, `<foreach>`), and let SQL return to SQL.
*   **Smart Processing**: Automatically handle null checks, prefix/suffix processing (such as automatically removing extra AND/OR or commas).
*   **Powerful**: Built-in rich rules such as `and`, `or`, `in`, `set`, `case`, etc., meet most dynamic SQL needs.

## Basic Example

Take the most common `AND` rule as an example. It can intelligently decide whether to append query conditions based on whether the parameter (`:name`) is empty:

```sql
-- Use @{and, ...} rule
select * from users where id > :id @{and, name = :name}
```

*   If `name` is not empty: Generates `... where id > ? and name = ?`
*   If `name` is empty: The rule is automatically ignored, generating `... where id > ?`

## More Rules

dbVisitor provides a wealth of built-in rules (such as `in` collection query, `set` dynamic update, `case` branch judgment, etc.), and even supports custom rules.

- [Dynamic SQL Rules](../rules/dynamic_rule) - Includes `@{and}` `@{or}` `@{in}` `@{set}` `@{case}`, etc.
- [Result Processing Rules](../rules/result_rule) - Rules for post-processing result sets.
- [Nested Rules](../rules/nested_rule) - Introduces how to implement complex logic through nested rules.
