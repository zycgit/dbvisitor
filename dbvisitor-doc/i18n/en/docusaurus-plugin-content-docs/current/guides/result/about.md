dbVisitor typically queries data through object mapping. For special cases, you can control how data is retrieved by implementing specific interfaces.

## Guide

- Customize how a ResultSet is read with [ResultSetExtractor](./for_extractor).
- Convert each row with [RowMapper](./for_mapper).
- Receive data using [List/Map](./for_map).
- Process each row via callbacks with [RowCallbackHandler](./row_callback).
