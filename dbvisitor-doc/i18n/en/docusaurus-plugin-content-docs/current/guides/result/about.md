dbVisitor provides multiple ways to process query results. By default, ORM mapping handles most scenarios.
For special requirements, you can customize result processing logic through the following interfaces.

## Guide

- Use the [RowMapper](./for_mapper) interface to map results row by row, returning one object per row.
- Receive data using [List/Map structures](./for_map), without defining entity classes.
- Use the [RowCallbackHandler](./row_callback) interface to process results row by row via callbacks (no collection, suitable for streaming scenarios).
- Use the [ResultSetExtractor](./for_extractor) interface for full control over ResultSet traversal and transformation.
