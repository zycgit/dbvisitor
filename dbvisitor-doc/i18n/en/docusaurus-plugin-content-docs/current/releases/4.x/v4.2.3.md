# v4.2.3 (2021-02-26)

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.hasor</groupId>
    <artifactId>hasor-db</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Added
- Added dialects for DM, Kingbase, Xugu, and `Oracle12c`.
- `LambdaOperations` interface adds `update`, `delete`, and `insert` contracts (implementation in the next release).

## Improved
- Promoted dialect implementations to top-level modules in the db project.
- Moved `jdbc.mapping` under `types` as a submodule since it aligns closely with types.
- Enhanced dialects with pagination support; pagination is integrated into `JdbcTemplate`.
- `applyConnection` and `setAccessorApply` now accept `EFunction`.
- Removed the `loggerErrors` property.
- Lambda-generated SQL now uses `?` placeholders directly instead of `map key` names.
- Moved `net.hasor.db.types.mapping` contents to `net.hasor.db.dal.orm`.

## Fixed
- Corrected the mapping for the DEFAULT isolation level.
