# v6.0.0 (2025-04-05)

:::info[Heads-up]
Treat this as a brand-new dbVisitor.
:::

v6.0.0 is a major breaking release. Starting in v6.0, all APIs follow unified mechanisms for **rules**, **parameters**, **result handling**, **type handling**, and **object mapping**.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.hasor</groupId>
    <artifactId>dbvisitor</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Breaking changes

- In 5.0, LambdaTemplate was renamed to WrapperAdapter; functionality mostly aligned, minor differences not enumerated.
- 5.0 transaction manager is carried forward.
- 5.0 `DalSession` renamed to `Session` with major internal changes.
- 5.0 `TableReader` interface removed.
- 5.0 primary-key generators `GeneratedKeyHandler` and `KeyHolder` are merged into one mechanism.
- `@Query`, `@Insert`, etc. drop the `xml` attribute; dynamic Command now uses rules or explicit Mapper Files.
- Multi-value handling strategy from 5.0 is removed in 6.0.
- `JdbcOperations` changed significantly and may be incompatible with 5.0.
- `LambdaOperations` in 6.0 adds tighter support for Map structures.
- dbVisitor no longer auto-detects dialects; specify via Options.
- Named-param syntax `groupId in (:groupIds)` is removed; `@{and, groupId in (:groupIds)}` rule is invalid—use the IN rule instead.
- `MappingRegistry.loadMapper(InputStream)` / `loadMapper(URL)` removed; use `loadMapper(String)` or `loadMapper(String, boolean)`.

## Docs
- 5.0 docs are no longer hosted; build them from source under tag v5.4.4 in `dbvisitor-doc` if needed.
