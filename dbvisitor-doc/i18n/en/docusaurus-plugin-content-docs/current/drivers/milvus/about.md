jdbc-milvus is a Milvus vector database JDBC driver adapter that allows developers to operate Milvus using standard JDBC interfaces and SQL-style commands.
Its purpose is to enable developers to seamlessly use Milvus vector database through the familiar JDBC programming model.

## Core Features

- JDBC compatible — implements standard JDBC interfaces for seamless integration with any JDBC-compatible framework.
- SQL-style syntax — operates Milvus using standard SQL structures like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `DELETE`.
- Vector search support — expresses KNN search via `ORDER BY field <-> vector`, and range search via `WHERE` clauses.
- Rich command set — supports database management, table management, index management, partition management, user and permission management, and more. See the Syntax Manual for details.
- Supports command parameter placeholder `?`, with parameters set via `PreparedStatement`.
- Full DDL support — includes collection creation (with vector field definitions), index creation (with index types and parameters), partition and alias management.
- Supports `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`, automatically returning the generated primary key on insert operations.
- Supports SQL Hints to override query `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, or convert queries to Count operations.
- Supports command interceptors for logging, performance monitoring, and similar scenarios.
- Flexible vector formats — supports JSON array literals, `?` parameter binding (`List<Float>`, `float[]`, etc.), and batch vector search.

## Architecture Design

jdbc-milvus internally uses the Milvus Java SDK for communication, parses SQL-style commands via ANTLR4, and converts them to Milvus SDK API calls.

## Use Cases

- Accessing Milvus vector database in a unified way (JDBC) within Java projects.
- Operating Milvus with SQL-style syntax to reduce the learning curve.
- Integrating Milvus into existing JDBC-based data processing pipelines.

## Compatibility

- JDK: 8+
- Milvus: 2.3.x or higher recommended (some features like `COUNT` require 2.2+)
