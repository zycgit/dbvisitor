With dbvisitor-driver, developers can more easily extend data source support, enabling applications to access various types of databases in a unified way. It is designed for the following scenarios:
- Integrating non-relational databases into JDBC-based applications.
- Projects that need to provide JDBC interfaces for custom data sources.

## Architecture Design

The project adopts an interface-oriented design pattern, consisting of the following core components:

1. Driver Entry
   - `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.JdbcDriver` implements the `java.sql.Driver` interface, responsible for URL parsing and creating supported connections.
   - The driver entry class mandates that all adapters follow the JDBC URL format: `jdbc:dbvisitor:<adapterName>//<server?param=value>`
2. Adapter Manager
   - The `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterManager` class manages and loads adapter factories, using the Java SPI mechanism to discover and register adapters.
3. JDBC Standard Implementation Layer
   - All classes prefixed with `Jdbc` under the `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.*` package implement JDBC standard interfaces.
4. Adapter Layer
   - The `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterFactory` interface is the adapter connection factory, responsible for creating `AdapterConnection` instances.
   - The `net.hasor.dbvisitor.driver.AdapterConnection` abstract class is the adapter connection, handling adapter requests and responses.
5. Type Support
   - TypeSupport, AdapterTypeSupport: Provide data type conversion support
   - ConvertUtils: Utility class for handling various data type conversions

## Technical Features
- **SPI Mechanism**: Dynamically loads adapters through the Java SPI mechanism, achieving a loosely coupled plugin architecture.
- **Type Conversion**: Provides a flexible type conversion system supporting mappings between various data types.
- **Request/Response Model**: Adopts a request/response model for database operations, facilitating adaptation to various data sources.
- **Compatibility**: Strives for compatibility with standard JDBC interfaces, with some limitations.
