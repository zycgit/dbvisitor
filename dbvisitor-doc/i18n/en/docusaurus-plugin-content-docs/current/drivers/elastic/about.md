jdbc-elastic is an ElasticSearch JDBC driver adapter that allows developers to operate ElasticSearch using standard JDBC interfaces and ElasticSearch native REST API-style commands.
Its purpose is to enable developers to seamlessly integrate and use ElasticSearch through the familiar JDBC programming model.

## Core Features

- **Native command support**: Supports commonly used ElasticSearch REST API commands, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.
- **JDBC standard interfaces**: Supports standard interfaces such as `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`.
- **Parameter placeholders**: Supports `?` placeholders in URL paths and JSON Body, with parameters set via `PreparedStatement`.
- **Result set mapping**: Automatically maps ElasticSearch JSON responses to JDBC `ResultSet`.
- **Auto-generated key return**: Supports `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`, automatically returning the generated `_id` on insert operations.
- **Multi-command support**: Supports batch operations like `_mget`, `_msearch`.
- **Index management**: Supports index creation, deletion, Mapping settings, Settings configuration, alias management, and more.
- **Pre-read optimization**: Supports pre-read configuration for large result sets to optimize read performance.
- **Multi-version compatibility**: Compatible with ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9 without dependency adjustments.

## Architecture Design

jdbc-elastic internally parses QueryDSL commands, converts them to underlying REST requests, and communicates using the official ElasticSearch REST Client.

## Use Cases

- Accessing ElasticSearch in a unified way (JDBC) within Java projects.
- Operating ElasticSearch with native REST API-style commands while leveraging JDBC convenience.
- Integrating ElasticSearch into existing JDBC-based data processing pipelines.
