JDBC driver adapters are a set of JDBC drivers implemented on the `dbvisitor-driver` framework. They integrate non-relational databases via standard JDBC interfaces.

Each adapter is an independent JDBC driver that can be used with any JDBC-compatible framework (such as Spring JDBC, MyBatis, dbVisitor, etc.), or directly through the native JDBC API.
They address the following core problems:
- **Simplified driver implementation**: By abstracting the complexity of JDBC interfaces, developers can more easily implement JDBC-compatible layers for various data sources.
- **Non-relational database integration**: Allows non-relational databases (NoSQL) to be accessed through standardized JDBC interfaces.
- **Unified access**: Works with any JDBC-based framework through standardized JDBC interfaces, simplifying database access operations.

## Usage Guide

- Available Adapters
  - **[jdbc-redis](./redis/about)** is a JDBC driver adapter for Redis, allowing developers to operate the database using standard JDBC interfaces and Redis commands.
  - **[jdbc-mongo](./mongo/about)** is a JDBC driver adapter for MongoDB, allowing developers to operate the database using standard JDBC interfaces and MongoDB commands.
  - **[jdbc-elastic](./elastic/about)** is a JDBC driver adapter for ElasticSearch, allowing developers to operate data using standard JDBC interfaces and ElasticSearch native QueryDSL commands.
  - **[jdbc-milvus](./milvus/about)** is a JDBC driver adapter for Milvus vector database, allowing developers to operate Milvus using standard JDBC interfaces and SQL-style commands.
- Developing New Adapters
  - **[Custom Adapter](./dev/about)** Learn how to develop a custom JDBC driver adapter to implement a JDBC-compatible layer for your own database.
